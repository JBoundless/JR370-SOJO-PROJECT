    <div class="introduction">
        <p>Racism has plagued the United States since its founding. The country was built on slavery, which legally existed until 1865 when it was ended with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 160 years later, there are still remnants of slavery in institutions all across the U.S. 
            The public school system is no exception. Boston’s school system, one of the models we looked at for integration efforts over the last 50 years, was built on segregation. The 1965 Racial Imbalance Act in Massachusetts led to separate and unequal schools for Black kids than those for white kids.</p>

    <div class="data">
        <p>As of five years ago, the integration policies of charter and magnet schools had improved somewhat, either on the districts’ own accords or through court mandates. <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/school-integration-america-looks-like-today/">The Century Foundation</a> discovered that 907 charter districts nationwide had policies that factored students’ race and socioeconomic status into their admission processes. 185 districts and charters held active integration policies (described with the below visualization), while the remaining 722 were “subject to a legal desegregation order or voluntary agreement.”</p>

            <p>“These 907 districts and charters with enforceable integration tools enroll one quarter of all public school students. The districts and charters with confirmed integration policies enroll seven million students (roughly 14 percent of total public school enrollment).”</p>

            <p>While public school enrollment generally increased across the country, the percentage of White students declined nationwide, from 61.2% to 45.4%, according to the UCLA Civil Rights Project. In the northeast and southern U.S., the percentage of both White and Black students enrolled in public schools decreased, while the percentage of Latino students increased—-up 11% in the northeast and 13% in the south. The same could be said for Asian students, albeit with smaller growth—up 3% in the northeast and 2% in the south.</p>
