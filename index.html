        <h2>Introduction and Problem</h2>
        <p>Racism has plagued the United States since its founding. The country was built on slavery, which legally existed until 1865 when it was ended with the ratification of the 13th Amendment. 160 years later, there are still remnants of slavery in institutions all across the U.S. </p>
        <p>The public school system is no exception. Boston’ school system, one of the models we looked at for integration efforts over the last 50 years, was built on segregation. Before the <a href="https://bosdesca.omeka.net/exhibits/show/racial-imbalance_bps/racial-imbalance-act-1965">1965 Racial Imbalance Act</a> in Massachusetts, there were separate and unequal schools for Black students opposed to those for white students. The legislation required public schools in Massachusetts to desegregate or lose their state funding.</p>
        <p>Based on census information from 1965, there were only 25.7% non-white students in Boston public schools that year. According to this data and other historical documents from the time, schools in predominantly African-American neighborhoods were underfunded and understaffed, resulting in unequal education rates among white students and non-white students.</p>
        <p>1600 miles away in Shreveport, Louisiana, schools did not fully integrate until 1981 in Caddo Parish—parish is Louisiana’s equivalent to county. Being a smaller city than Boston, and situated in the deeply conservative South, there was less of a social movement to integrate. States all across the South fought forced school integration following the 1954 Supreme Court Brown v. Board of Education ruling that found “separate but equal” schools in violation of the 14th amendment.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, integration was inevitable, and school districts across the country were forced to comply over the 30 years after Brown. The federal government did not specify how this integration would happen; that decision was left to states and school districts to figure out. </p>
        <p>From this era of court-mandated desegregation, different areas of the country approached it through different means. For our project, we focused on Boston’s use of voluntary busing programs (METCO) and Shreveport’s creation of magnet schools.</p>

        <h2>Solutions</h2>

        <h3>Boston - Voluntary Busing / METCO</h3>
        <p>In 1966, the Metropolitan Council for Education Opportunity (<a href="https://metcoinc.org/about/">METCO</a>) was founded in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a voluntary busing program. While integration was mandated, forcibly busing students to new schools did not prove as successful as planned. <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/a-walking-tour-of-bostons-busing-history">“Fury and violence”</a> broke out across the city in response to “busing 20,000 white and Black students to classrooms across the city.”</p>
            <p>METCO was different. Formed as a coalition between local school districts, state government, and a non-profit organization, METCO aims to “promote school diversity, close the achievement gap, and overcome racial barriers” through voluntary busing, according to their website.</p>
            <p>The current CEO of METCO Milly Arbaje-Thomas came into the role in 2018. She plans to step away from the role this summer after leading the program for seven years.</p>
            <p>In the almost 60 years since its founding, METCO has <a href="https://www.datiak12.io/leadership/policy-legislation/article/15708209/the-74-study-finds-bostons-busing-program-has-had-a-significant-educational-impact">become</a> “one of the longest-running voluntary desegregation programs in the country.” A 2024 study by Tufts University economist Elizabeth Setren revealed the success of this program in racial integration in Massachusetts schools. Dropout rates reduced and on-time graduation rates increased for students partaking in the program.</p>
            <p>Arbaje-Thomas echoed the results of Setren’s study. During her time running METCO, Arbaje-Thomas cited three main areas she focused on improving: equity, modernization, and antiracism work. In terms of equity, she made the application process more accessible, moving it online as opposed to in-person as it had been for decades. Just last year, Arbaje-Thomas gave parents a choice over what school their child attended through the METCO program.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest improvements Arbaje-Thomas said was the modernization of METCO. She helped open a larger office, implementing a conference hall honoring the history of METCO, which helped instill pride in students and teach them “how much of a civil rights activist movement METCO was.”</p>
            <p>Above all, METCO’s success came from the voluntary aspect of the program. “I believe so much in voluntary work,” Arbaje-Thomas said. “When people want it, that success is much better than when it’s mandated.”</p>

        <h3>Shreveport - Magnet Schools</h3>
        <p>In Shreveport, the efforts towards integration were slower. While minority groups in the South wanted equal rights, they were not originally in favor of forced integration. According to Caddo Parish’s superintendent at the time Walter Lee, “voluntary integration did not change much. There was a real resistance to integration by all racial groups.”</p> 
            <p>Lee, who is now 90 years old, served as superintendent in Caddo from 1977-1997, one of the most pivotal times in the history of Shreveport’s education. He came into the role as an “outsider,” in his own words. Lee was not an educator before taking on the job—he was a business manager. </p>
            <p>In the lower part of the state, Baton Rouge Magnet High School was the first “magnet” school in Louisiana. <a href="https://magnet.edu/about/what-are-magnet-schools#:~:text=Magnet%20Schools%20attract%20children%20of,many%20cases%2C%20exceed%20those%20standards.">Magnet schools</a> are best described as an intersection between public and private schools. It takes the appeal of school choice and applies it to a free, public school that any student has an opportunity to attend, regardless of where they live in a city—opposed to neighborhood public schools, where students attend the closest school to their residence. Lee was intrigued by this school and decided to adapt it to Shreveport to help with integration. </p>
            <p>In 1980, Lee opened the first magnet school in Shreveport: Caddo Parish Magnet High. When working with the federal government to open magnet schools around the district, Caddo agreed to open the new schools in predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Shreveport. This was in part because there was no transportation originally available for these magnet schools, so placing them in minority neighborhoods increased access for all students. </p>
            <p>Lee said this was also a result of the community’s negative reaction to forced busing. “I felt like parents should be able to have a choice,” Lee said. “They were paying for public education through their taxes, yet the public education system was not acceptable.” Magnet schools were a compromise where parents were given choice over their child’s education without having to pay for private school. </p>
            <p>40 years later, Caddo Parish has magnet schools at all levels, many of which are the most academically successful schools in the state. The original magnet school, Caddo Parish Magnet High, is <a href="https://caddomagnet.net/admissions/about-magnet/accolades/">rated</a> the best high school in northern Louisiana and consistently sees graduates attend Ivy League Universities. Per the most recent 2024 data, the school has a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/louisiana/districts/caddo-parish-public-schools/caddo-parish-magnet-high-school-8548">41% minority enrollment</a> and has a more than 95% graduation rate. </p>

    <div class="data">
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>As of five years ago, the integration policies of charter and magnet schools had improved somewhat, either on the districts’ own accords or through court mandates. <a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/school-integration-america-looks-like-today/">The Century Foundation</a> discovered that 907 charter districts nationwide had policies that factored students’ race and socioeconomic status into their admission processes. 185 districts and charters held active integration policies (described with the below visualization), while the remaining 722 were “subject to a legal desegregation order or voluntary agreement.”</p>

            <p>“These 907 districts and charters with enforceable integration tools enroll one quarter of all public school students. The districts and charters with confirmed integration policies enroll seven million students (roughly 14 percent of total public school enrollment).”</p>

            <p>While public school enrollment generally increased across the country, the percentage of White students declined nationwide, from 61.2% to 45.4%, according to the UCLA Civil Rights Project. In the northeast and southern U.S., the percentage of both White and Black students enrolled in public schools decreased, while the percentage of Latino students increased—-up 11% in the northeast and 13% in the south. The same could be said for Asian students, albeit with smaller growth—up 3% in the northeast and 2% in the south.</p>

    <div class="insights-limitations">
        <h2>Insights and Limitations</h2>
        <p>Magnet schools and busing programs were just two approaches that school districts utilized to comply with federal mandated school integration. They both had, and continue to have, positive and negative effects on the communities in which they were implemented. 
            <p>METCO was proven to reduce dropout rates in Massachusetts schools by 75% and increased on-time high school graduation by 13 percentage points, according to a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32864">study</a> conducted by Tufts University economist Elizabeth Setren. However, due to its voluntary nature, segregation is not nonexistent in Massachusetts schools today. Only 37% of public schools in Massachusetts, per 2024 data from the Racial Imbalance Advisory Committee, are considered “racially diverse.”</p> 
            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/22254983"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22254983/thumbnail" width="75%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
            <p>While education and graduation rates for minority students have increased since METCO’s founding, it still is not the perfect solution as it is not available to every student. 39% of Massachusetts schools are categorized as “racially segregated”  with a majority of white students attending.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the magnet school system in Shreveport also is not without fault. While magnet schools are more racially diverse and provide opportunities for minority students in Shreveport, the public school system still faces racial inequity that the existence of magnet schools only perpetuates.</p>
            <p>Magnet schools do come with a barrier to entry that neighborhood schools don’t have: for Caddo Parish Magnet High in Shreveport, students must have a 2.5 GPA or higher to be considered, as well as reach certain thresholds on state examinations. Magnet schools have been proven to “pull” higher achieving students out of their neighborhood schools, as well as attract the best teachers in the area. While Caddo Parish Magnet High has been an “A” rated school for the past few years, many neighborhood schools in the area have been failing, with a few being forced to close in the past few years due to a poor level of education and lack of funding. </p>
            <p>The schools in the United States that have the most racial diversity and highest education levels across all racial groups are those that have multiple integration systems in practice (ie. magnet schools, charter schools, mandatory and voluntary busing programs). </p>
            <p>Since the turn of the 21st century, enrollment in public schools has increased in the U.S. from 45,000,000 in 2000 to more than 48,000,000 in 2021. However, when looking at specific regions of the U.S., this is not the full story. In the Northeast, enrollment in public schools has actually decreased by more than 600,000 students. In the South, enrollment has seen a more than 3,000,000 million increase. </p>
            <p>Busing programs are more prominently seen in the Northeast while magnet schools are more common in the South. The limitations of each of these systems of integration most likely have led to these regional changes.</p>
